When I started my trip I was interested in seeing how my face would change over a years worth of travel. My goal was to take a selfie photo every day but that soon went out the window. I averaged about one photo every three days instead. I tried to keep as neutral an expression as possible on my face but sometimes I smiled. I also tried to have a background that was indicative of where I was in the world at the time.
