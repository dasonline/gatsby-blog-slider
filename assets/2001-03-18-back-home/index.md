I am back in Dallas. I decided to cut my trip short for now and finish it next year. I came home for two reasons; I thought I was running short of money (I’m not) and I was offered a job on a movie here in Texas (it has since fallen through). It is nice to be home for now but I’m already ready to hit the road again. I will probably wait until next winter before I leave again. I liked not being here for the cold weather. It is also the best time of year to travel through Southeast Asia. The rest of the year is either too hot or monsoon season. On my way home to Dallas I stopped in Hong Kong for a little last minute shopping. It is a huge city filled with designer stores and skyscrapers. It didn’t have the good deals that I thought it would. Everything was expensive. I still feel the best shopping is in Beijing and India, with Thailand not far behind. In Beijing I bought CD’s for less than a dollar and DVD’s for less than two dollars. I stocked up. India is the place to shop for precious stones and textiles. I’m going to research starting a small import business.  
When I develop my photos I will try to scan some and email a few out. Thanks to all the people who wrote to me when I was on the road and I will keep you all informed as to when the next e-journal will start.

No Longer On The Road,
